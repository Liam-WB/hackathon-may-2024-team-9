# Mindwars

## Introduction

May 2024 [#47 Hackahton:]((https://hackathon.codeinstitute.net/hackathon/47/))
Code Wars: The Hackathon Strikes Back

Code Troopers presents "Mindwars", an interactive Star Wars themed trivia quiz style game with a twist.

In a galaxy not so far away, a random group of intrepid heroes have come together to put an end to the Emperor. In order to achieve this, co-operation, planning, division of labour and creative effort are required. 

The project was planned and executed according to the Agile principle. 

Combined with the calm and composure of a Jedi, and in some cases the tenacity of a restless Sith, we have managed to offer the Emperor a battle in which everyone can participate.

The Code Troopers have laid the groundwork, and now we invite you to join us in the fight against the Emperor.

## Gameplay

### Characters

You will have a choice of 5 characters to choose to play as. Pick wisely as each character have their own perks while completing the trivia:

- **Yoda**  
	- Force Sense; on activating this perk you will automatically detect the correct answer.
- **Luke** 
	- Force Meditation; on activating this perk you will gain additional time to answer a question giving you the potential to get bonus point.
- **Darth Vader**  
	- Dark Force; on activating this perk you will gain bonus points for answering correctly.
- **Princess Leia**  
	- Force Empathy; on activating this perk you will be able to change the question asked.
- **Han Solo**  
	- Expert Markman; on activating this perk, two incorrect answers will be eliminated.

### Stages

#### **Stage 1**

- Requires you to play a multiple choice-based trivia game, split into 3 levels of increasing difficulty.
- Jedi Apprentice, Jedi Knight and Jedi master with 5 questions per level, and 30 seconds per question to answer.
- The faster you select the correct answer the greater the points scored will be.
- To also aid you in stage 2; in each difficulty level, if you succeed in answering all 5 questions correctly, you will uncover battle armour able to be used in the final stage.

#### **Stage 2**

- Will involve you battling the mystery disturbance detected, following a Rock, Paper, scissor style battle.

#### Hall of Fame
- To reach the leaderboards you will need to be both swift and precise.
- Each question answered correctly will give you 10pt.
- the quicker you answer them will multiply the points and a difficulty factor of 1, 2 or 3.
